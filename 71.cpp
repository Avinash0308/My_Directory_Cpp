        containers are of three types :-
        1. Sequence containers
            a. vectors
            b. list
            c. Dequeue (Double Ended Queue)
        2. Associative containers
            a. Map
            b. Multimap
            c. Set
            d. Multiset
        3. Derived containers
            a. Stack
            b. Queue
